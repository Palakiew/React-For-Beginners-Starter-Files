React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React is used to build single-page applications.

React allows us to create reusable UI components.
Learning by Examples

Our "Show React" tool makes it easy to demonstrate React. It shows both the code and the result.
Example:

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

function Hello(props) {
  return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
}

const container = document.getElementById("root");
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);
root.render(<Hello />);
Create React App

To learn and test React, you should set up a React Environment on your computer.

This tutorial uses the create-react-app.

The create-react-app tool is an officially supported way to create React applications.

Node.js is required to use create-react-app.

Open your terminal in the directory you would like to create your application.

Run this command to create a React application named my-react-app:
npx create-react-app my-react-app
create-react-app will set up everything you need to run a React application.

Note: If you've previously installed create-react-app globally, it is recommended that you uninstall the package to ensure npx always uses the latest version of create-react-app. To uninstall, run this command: npm uninstall -g create-react-app.
Run the React Application

Run this command to move to the my-react-app directory:
cd my-react-app
Run this command to execute the React application my-react-app:
npm start

A new browser window will pop up with your newly created React App! If not, open your browser and type localhost:3000 in the address bar.
